# KPIDashboard
In order to support a team working under the Scrum methodology, a new tool has been developed to monitor, check and analyse in real time the status and progress of a project through user-friendly Dashboards. 

Thanks to the metrics and indicators that provide information on a specific key factor in the development of a project, known as KPIs, any member of a project can know how it is working and if it is being done in the right way without the need to know the processes used.  

For this purpose, a web application has been developed to consult and build KPIs based on the analysis of the data provided and generated by the projects themselves or by external sources such as Scrum Boards. 

These indicators are displayed by the application in a graphical, simple and orderly manner in  an  environment  very  similar  to  a  real  production  one,  providing  the  application  with  a  certain business intelligence, robustness and efficiency
