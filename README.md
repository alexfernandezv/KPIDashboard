# KPIDashboard
In order to support a team working under the Scrum methodology, a new tool has beendeveloped to monitor, check and analyse in real time the status and progress of a project throughuser-friendly Dashboards. Thanks to the metrics and indicators that provide information on a specifickey factor in the development of a project, known as KPIs, any member of a project can know how itis working and if it is being done in the right way without the need to know the processes used.  Forthis purpose, a web application has been developed to consult and build KPIs based on the analysisof the data provided and generated by the projects themselves or by external sources such as ScrumBoards. These indicators are displayed by the application in a graphical, simple and orderly mannerin  an  environment  very  similar  to  a  real  production  one,  providing  the  application  with  a  certainbusiness intelligence, robustness and efficiency
